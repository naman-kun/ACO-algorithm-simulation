The current implementation is partially functional but visually unclear and conceptually opaque.

While some parameters change numerical behavior, the simulation does not clearly communicate:

why ants are choosing certain paths

how they are responding to threats

how Alpha, Beta, and Rho actually influence decisions

how this maps to real antivirus logic

You must fix both logic execution and visual explainability.

0. CRITICAL VISIBILITY FIX (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Problem:

Some file nodes are hidden or clipped in the bottom half of the canvas

Important interactions are occurring off-screen

Fix (REQUIRED):

Ensure ALL file nodes are fully visible at all times

Constrain node placement to visible canvas bounds

If any file cannot be rendered clearly:

Do NOT include it in the simulation

Dynamically scale or reposition layout if needed

Nothing meaningful should happen outside the visible area.

1. MALWARE SPREAD IS STILL NOT CLEAR (MUST FIX)

Problem:

Malware spread is not visually traceable

Viewer cannot point to a specific path and say “infection moved here”

Fix (REQUIRED):

Implement malware as a clearly visible Path-Based Infection Wave:

When a file becomes infected:

Spawn infection waves along its outgoing paths

Each wave must:

Move visibly along the path over time

Be rendered as a red pulse / flowing segment

When the wave reaches another file:

That file transitions state (clean → suspicious → infected)

Increasing malware speed must:

Increase wave speed

Increase number of infected files

Increase visible threat density

If this is not visually obvious, the implementation is incorrect.

2. ANTS MUST EXPLAIN THEIR OWN DECISIONS VISUALLY

Problem:

Ants move along fixed paths, but it is unclear why

Viewer cannot tell what information ants are reacting to

Fix (MANDATORY):

For every ant decision, make the decision factors visually explicit:

When an ant chooses a path:

Briefly highlight the selected path

When pheromone influences a decision:

Path glow or thickness must visibly bias choice

When anomaly (infection) influences a decision:

Infected or suspicious files must visibly “pull” ants toward them

The viewer must be able to see the decision being made.

3. ALPHA (α) MUST VISIBLY CONTROL MEMORY

Problem:

Increasing alpha does not clearly change behavior

Fix:

Apply alpha exactly as:

pheromoneInfluence = pheromone ^ alpha


Visual expectations:

Alpha ≈ 0 → ants explore broadly, paths remain thin

Alpha high → ants strongly reuse existing pheromone paths

High-pheromone paths must become obvious “highways”

When alpha is adjusted live:

Ant routing must change immediately

Path dominance must visibly shift

4. BETA (β) MUST VISIBLY CONTROL THREAT RESPONSE

Problem:

Beta does not clearly redirect ants toward threats

Fix:

Apply beta exactly as:

heuristicInfluence = anomalyScore ^ beta


Visual expectations:

Low beta → ants behave mostly exploratively

High beta → ants aggressively reroute toward infected files

When beta changes during runtime:

Ant paths must visibly reorient toward threats

This must look like real-time threat prioritization, not random motion.

5. ACO FORMULA MUST DIRECTLY SHAPE WHAT IS SEEN

Problem:

ACO math may exist but does not explain the visuals

Fix (MANDATORY):

For each ant decision:

Compute a score for every possible path using:

pheromone ^ alpha

anomalyScore ^ beta

Normalize probabilities

Sample path

Then visually reinforce the outcome:

Paths chosen more often must:

Gain pheromone faster

Become thicker and more saturated

Rarely chosen paths must fade

The simulation should be readable even without reading code.

6. PHEROMONES MUST BE OBVIOUS AND MEANINGFUL

Problem:

Pheromones exist but are not clearly legible

Fix:

Pheromones must exist ONLY on paths

When ants detect threats:

Deposit strong, visible pheromone

Scale visuals non-linearly:

Small pheromone → barely visible

Large pheromone → thick, intense path

Rho (ρ) must:

Evaporate pheromones every tick

Visibly erase outdated or false paths

Make forgetting obvious

7. SHOW ACTIVE RESPONSE, NOT STATIC PATHS

Problem:

Paths exist but it is unclear how the system is “responding”

Fix:

Make the system visibly adaptive:

As threats grow:

More ants must converge

Pheromone paths must reorganize

As threats fade:

Paths must weaken and disappear

Ants must redistribute

This must look like live adaptation, not pre-drawn routing.

8. EXPLICIT CYBERSECURITY INTERPRETATION (REQUIRED)

Visually and textually communicate that:

Ants = decentralized security agents

Pheromones = shared threat intelligence

Infected files = compromised resources

Path reinforcement = correlated threat confidence

This should resemble how modern antivirus systems prioritize and adapt, not static graph traversal.

9. UPDATED VISUAL LEGEND (REQUIRED BELOW SIMULATION)

Below the simulation, clearly explain:

Red moving pulse → malware infection wave

Red file → infected

Yellow file → suspicious

Green file → clean

Small moving dots → security agents

Thick red path → high pheromone (high threat confidence)

Thin blue/grey path → low pheromone (forgotten / safe)

This explanation must directly match what is rendered.

10. FINAL VALIDATION RULE

The final simulation must allow a viewer to answer, by sight alone:

Where is the malware spreading?

Why are ants choosing these paths?

How did alpha, beta, and rho change behavior?

How is the system adapting in real time?

If these answers are not visually obvious, the implementation is incomplete.
