You must build a real-time, interactive Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) simulation for cybersecurity where ALL parameter changes immediately affect agent behavior and paths while the simulation is running.

This is non-negotiable.

1. REAL-TIME PARAMETER REACTIVITY (CRITICAL)

All parameters must be read every simulation tick, not cached.

When the user changes:

Alpha (α)

Beta (β)

Rho (ρ)

Malware speed

Number of ants

The very next movement decision of every ant must reflect the new values.

There must be:

No restart required

No reset required

No delayed effect

If paths do not visibly change immediately after slider movement, the implementation is incorrect.

2. ANT PATHS MUST VISIBLY CHANGE (MANDATORY)

Ants must:

Travel from file to file along visible paths

Choose paths probabilistically using ACO

When:

Alpha increases → ants must visibly prefer established pheromone paths

Beta increases → ants must visibly prefer currently infected or suspicious files

Rho increases → previously strong paths must visibly fade and disappear faster

This must be clearly observable on screen, not just mathematically correct.

3. TRUE PATH-BASED INFECTION WAVE (REQUIRED)

Malware must spread as a path-based infection wave, not particles.

Implementation rules:

Malware starts at one or more file nodes

Each infected file periodically emits a red infection wave

The wave travels along existing paths between files

The wave is animated moving along the path

When the wave reaches another file:

That file changes state (clean → suspicious → infected)

The file is marked as an active threat

Increasing malware speed must:

Make waves travel faster

Infect more files in less time

Increase the number of red/suspicious files on screen

If malware spread speed increases but nothing visually changes, the implementation is wrong.

4. ANT RESPONSE TO MALWARE (LOGIC REQUIRED)

When malware infects files:

Infected files must increase their anomalyScore

Ants visiting those files must:

Deposit pheromones on the path they used to reach the file

This pheromone acts as a threat report

As more files get infected:

More ants must visibly converge on those regions

This convergence must be emergent, not scripted

5. PHEROMONES MUST BE VISIBLE (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Pheromones must:

Exist ONLY on paths between files

Be deposited when ants detect threats

Evaporate continuously using Rho (ρ)

Visual representation:

Path thickness increases with pheromone concentration

Path color shifts toward red with higher pheromone

Low-pheromone paths must visibly fade

If pheromones are not clearly visible on paths, the simulation fails its goal.

6. AGENT POPULATION MUST BE VISUAL

When the user increases the number of ants:

More ant agents must immediately appear

They must be individually visible

They must participate in path selection

This must be obvious without reading numbers.

7. ACO FORMULA MUST BE CORRECTLY APPLIED

Ant decision rule at each file:

For each connected path:

Pheromone influence = (pheromone ^ alpha)

Heuristic influence = (file.anomalyScore ^ beta)

Multiply the two

Normalize probabilities

Sample next path

Alpha, beta, and rho must not be decorative sliders.
If changing them does not change behavior, the implementation is invalid.

8. PHEROMONE EVAPORATION (ρ)

Every simulation tick:

Reduce pheromone on ALL paths using rho

Old threat paths must disappear over time

False positives must fade naturally

This must be visually obvious.

9. VISUAL LEGEND (REQUIRED BELOW SIMULATION)

Below the simulation, include a clear legend explaining visuals, for example:

Green file → clean

Yellow file → suspicious

Red file → infected

Red wave on path → malware spreading

Small moving dots → security ants

Thick red path → high pheromone (high threat confidence)

Thin blue path → low pheromone (safe)

This explanation must update with what is shown on screen.

10. FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

The finished simulation must make it obvious that:

Malware spreads along paths

Ants dynamically change routes as parameters change

More malware → more ants converge

Pheromone paths strengthen and fade

Alpha, beta, rho materially change system behavior

If the visualization still looks like random dots moving, the task is not complete.

IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE ABOVE NOW
